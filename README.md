## 8. PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE
The project maintains a clean and organized directory structure for scalability:
```
vikash/
├── css/
│   ├── styles.css      # Core stylesheet containing all visual styles, variables, and media queries
│   └── cursor.css      # Specific styles for the custom interactive cursor animation

└── README.md           # Comprehensive project documentation and report
```

## 9. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
This section highlights specific code implementations that drive the website's core features.

*   **Glassmorphism Effect (CSS)**:
    The premium "frosted glass" look is achieved using `backdrop-filter` combined with semi-transparent backgrounds.
    ```css
    .glass-card {
        background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
        backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
        -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
        border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
        box-shadow: 0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    }
    ```

*   **Scroll Reveal Animation (JavaScript)**:
    Instead of listening to the scroll event (which is performance-heavy), the `IntersectionObserver` API is used to trigger animations only when elements enter the viewport.
    ```javascript
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
        entries.forEach(entry => {
            if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                entry.target.classList.add('show');
            }
        });
    });
    ```

*   **Custom Cursor Logic**:
    The cursor uses a linear interpolation (lerp) function to create a smooth "trailing" effect for the outline.
    ```javascript
    // Pseudo-code for cursor movement
    const moveCursor = (e) => {
        const posX = e.clientX;
        const posY = e.clientY;
        cursorDot.style.left = `${posX}px`;
        cursorDot.style.top = `${posY}px`;
        // Outline follows with delay...
    }
    ```

## 10. UI/UX DESIGN STRATEGY
A deliberate design strategy was employed to ensure the site is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.

*   **Color Palette**:
    *   **Background**: `#0f172a` (Slate 900) - A deep, professional dark blue that reduces eye strain.
    *   **Primary Accent**: `#38bdf8` (Sky 400) - Used for buttons, links, and active states to guide user attention.
    *   **Secondary Accent**: `#f472b6` (Pink 400) - Used for gradients and subtle highlights to add vibrancy.
    *   **Text**: `#f1f5f9` (Slate 100) - High contrast off-white for maximum readability.

*   **Typography**:
    *   **Headings**: **'Outfit'** - A modern, geometric sans-serif font that conveys professionalism.
    *   **Body Text**: **'Inter'** - A clean, highly legible font optimized for computer screens.
    *   **Code Snippets**: **'Fira Code'** - A monospaced font with ligatures, perfect for the "developer" aesthetic.

## 11. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
Several techniques were used to ensure the website achieves a high Lighthouse score:
*   **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`) helps search engines and screen readers understand the content structure.
*   **Asset Optimization**: Images are compressed and served in appropriate formats to reduce payload size.
*   **CSS Variables**: Using variables reduces code repetition and makes the stylesheet smaller and easier to maintain.
*   **Efficient JavaScript**: Event listeners are passive where possible, and heavy computations are avoided on the main thread.
*   **Font Loading**: Google Fonts are preconnected (`<link rel="preconnect">`) to reduce latency.

## 12. MY WORK (OUTPUT)

The final delivered product is a fully functional, responsive, and interactive portfolio website. The application is structured into distinct, purpose-driven sections:

### 12.1 Hero Section (The Hook)
